        <p>This project was made with a very clear and practical goal tending to ease the work of
the flight reservation authorities at the airports. The project was a java based visual application which was capable
of booking a seat for a passenger who wishes and even cancel it at later times if needed. The practical
implementations of the project has yet a lot of live potentials in it. Additional features such as creating a displaying
of all the passenger who have made a reservation and few more manipulating tasks were also made available
through it.</p>
